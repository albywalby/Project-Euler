# Project Euler
 Solutions to problems taken from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). These solutions were written in the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/) using [Jupyter Notebooks/Jupyter Labs](https://jupyter.org/).

This is just a little side project I'm working on to learn more about algorithms and how to use Julia. I don't expect to finish every problem (since there are over 500 problems and I am just one person) but I would like to finish the first 100 problems.
