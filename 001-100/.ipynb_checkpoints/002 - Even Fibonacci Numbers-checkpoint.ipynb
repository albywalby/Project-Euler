    "In order to count up towards a limit with Fibonacci's sequence, we have to use a while loop. Here I used 3 variables `n1`, `n2`, and `n3` as sequential terms in the Fibonacci's sequence. As long as `n3` was less than `FOUR_MILLION` the loop would continue adding `n1` and `n2` towards `n3`. `n1` would then change to the value of `n2` and `n2` would then change to the value of `n3` to keep allowing the sequence to grow. Then we'd check to see if `n3` is even and add it to the `sum` if it is."
